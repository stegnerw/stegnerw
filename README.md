### Greetings üëã

My name is Wayne and I am a huge nerd who likes coding and working on hobby projects for fun.
I particularly enjoy projects involving robotics/embedded systems, machine learning, complex systems, and anything to do with penguins.
I have an unhealthy obsession with penguins. üêß
